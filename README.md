# odin-knight-travails
Practice with using breadth-first search (BFS) on a "graph".

## Details:
- uses BFS to determine one of the shortest paths a knight piece can take from one cell of a chessboard to another cell of the chessboard
- knightMoves(start, end) prints to the console the cells traversed (in order from start to end) for the shortetest path and also returns a list of those cells
